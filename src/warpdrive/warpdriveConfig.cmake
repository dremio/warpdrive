# This config sets the following variables in your project::
#
#   WARPDRIVE_FULL_SO_VERSION - full shared library version of the found Warpdrive
#   WARPDRIVE_SO_VERSION - shared library version of the found Warpdrive
#   WARPDRIVE_VERSION - version of the found Warpdrive
#   WARPDRIVE_* - options used when the found Warpdrive is build such as WARPDRIVE_COMPUTE
#   Warpdrive_FOUND - true if Warpdrive found on the system
#
# This config sets the following targets in your project::
#
#   warpdrive_shared - for linked as shared library if shared library is built
#   warpdrive_static - for linked as static library if static library is built
